This directory (/custom/files) must be readable/writable
by the webserver.  This is where modules will store uploaded files.

One example of how to make this directory writable would be
with the CHMOD command.

Ex:  chmod 777 files

Your specific operating system and webserver environment may
call for other solutions.
