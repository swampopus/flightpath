FlightPath 6.x Changelog
========================

2022-01-01
  Added new base_url() function.
  
  Created new concept of "public files" which users may upload to a special directory under /custom/files/content_uploads/public_uploads.  This screen is on a subtab
  from the normal Content screen, and allows users to upload and delete files (with allowed extensions) for use outside of FlightPath, or when linking
  to CSS or other files from within settings.
  

2021-12-30
  Added new indexes to watchdog table for faster reporting.
  
  Fixed typo in descriptions in encryption module.

  Updated cli.php to also allow db updates from the command line, as well as display help if no arguments
  are sent, or if ?, -h, --help, or help or sent.
  

2021-12-29
  Added more permissions and security checks when accessing files and content, especially of the user is a student and just trying out
  URLs.  We make sure they do not have access to any content, comments, or files they aren't supposed to see.  
  
  Added icon for encryption module, removed old, unused settings from hook_menu items throughout FlightPath.
  

2021-12-28
  Adding new module to core: encryption, and setting up key variable in settings.php on installation (giving it a random string value at the time of
  installation).
  
  Adding ability to save all content files as encrypted, and properly decrypt them for end user, based on if the user has permission to view
  the original content it was attached to.
  

2021-12-27
  Adding ability to have encrypted files for content_files.  Also, that table tells which piece of content the file belongs to, if any.
  
  Made it so if $content->title is unset, false, or null, then on save we give a simple default value.  This is to stop of mysql integrity
  constraint where the title cannot be null.

  Altered engagements so that received files (via email or SMS) go to temp directory on server first, before we then attach them to a piece
  of content via its cid in the content_files table.
  
  Fixed minor sorting issue on Engagements main tab screen.
  
  Altered content module's install so that is_encrypted and cid are both in the table, so we can figure out which piece of content (and therefor, permissions)
  the file is related to.
  


2021-12-22
  Added a strip_tags() call in course_search module, just to make sure we do not display dangerous user-supplied input.


2021-12-21
  Stored results of content_get_types() to a simple GLOBALS cache to reduce amount of times we look for it.
  
  Altered Calendar module to include instructions for de-authorizing Zoom.

  Fixed bug in Calendar where Zoom was hardcoded to look for user 1 (admin) tokens.
  

2021-12-19
  Moved all Zoom functionality into its own (private) module called zoomapi.  Updated other core modules to adjust and check for zoomapi before trying to call
  functions. 


2021-12-18
  Fixed bug in system_enable_module() where status was being sent the schema value instead of "1"


2021-12-17
  Cleaned up old comments.
  
  Fixed bug where we were determing a course's transfer eqv.  It was failing even though the souce hours were within the range
  of min and max hours.  (We were only looking at == max hours, rather than a range from min to max).

  Fixed bug so that the "mini search" at top of the screen will cause the Students tab to "remember" last search.
  
  Added concept of "return to student" to the top nav of all pages, so you can quickly return to the last student you had pulled up.
  This only works for faculty users with something in $_SESSION['last_student_selected'].
  
  Added "E" to default enrolled grades, and "F,W,I" to default retake grades.

  We now log (as WATCHDOG_DEBUG) when user tries to access a page and gets either a 404 Not Found or 403 Access Denied.

  Suppress rare warning when calling session_destroy().
  

2021-12-15
  Adding some extra instructions for the edit groups page.

  Fixed bug where courses worth less than 1 credit hour were not showing as repeatable in groups, even when the "set catalog repeats" box was checked.
    
  Adding concept of "delete_flag" to advising_sessions table, similar to the advising_comments table.  Also added permission to let users delete advising sessions
  for up to 3 months after posting, again, similar to the comments module.
    
  Updated comments module to make sure only the original author of a comment can delete it.
  
  
      

2021-12-14
  Added extra protection in our _fp_error_handler to not accidentally log passwords in plaintext.
  
  Fixed small bug in viewing watchdog entries where page was set to 1, always sending us to the second page
  of results if we clicked the Watchdog breadcrumb. 
  

2021-12-13
  Added code to create /custom/files/content_uploads/ folder.  Updated content module and engagements module
  to place uploaded files there.
  
  Fixed spelling of "README" file.
  

2021-12-12
  In calendar, when parsing ical feeds, we now correctly ignore time marked as "free" (transp == TRANSPARENT in the event).  Also fixed bug where you couldn't schedule appointments
  on the exact start and stop hour of a date's availability window (based on the "default" setting for that unavail time).
  
  Altered the way Zoom API works to better support api specs for Zoom marketplace apps.
  
  If SMS is not enabled, then txt messages cannot be selected as a default notification method.
  

2021-12-09
  Added more watchdog (debug) statements having to do with checking IMAP server for messages.
  

2021-12-08
  Fixed error in engagements where test name was being shown as author of engagement.
   

2021-12-07
  Small modifications to media.css.
  

2021-12-02
  Added a README.txt file under custom/themes so that the themes folder will be created upon install.
  

2021-11-26
  Implemented multi-factor authentication (via email) for local users.  The user can also choose to have their device "remembered" for 30 days, so they are not asked to
  re-authenticate every time.  This will only work for local users with email addresses saved.  Users with no email address, or users using LDAP, SSO, etc, will not
  be prompted to enter MFA code.
  
  Added convenience string functions like str_starts_with() to misc.inc, if not included.  These are implemented in PHP 8; they are here for users not running PHP 8.
  
  Added admin email address as a required field in the initial install script for FlightPath.


2021-11-23
  Fixed bug where advising snapshot (on dashboard) wasn't taking all advisees into account, only the first 20.  Simultaneously added
  code to allow for more than 20 student results at a time.  Previously 20 was hard-coded, not a variable.

  Converted the "Contact the FlightPath Production Team" popup window into a dialog.


2021-11-19
  For the content type "schedule_unavailable_time", changed the ics url field to a textarea and text (in mysql) to be able to handle URLs longer than 255 chars.

  Fixed bug in install process where current schema of modules were not being set, causing the user to be told they need to run db updates even
  on first install.
  
  Enable almost all core modules on initial install.
  
  Modified smtp module so that if we send a blank message it will just not send (but log it) rather than show an error message.
  

2021-11-18
  Added "spinner" to submit button for duplicating an entire year of degree data.

  Watchdog page converted to use sortable table and pager query.  Also added severity as column.
  
  Fixed bug in major students progress report (wasn't paying attention to school properly)
  
  Fixed bug where if student's school wasn't set correctly, it would look it up upon object creation.
  

2021-11-16
  Gave "clear all cache" its own permission.
  
  Cleaning up CSS.


2021-11-02
  Added concept of "capacity" to course_search module (stored per-term in the course_rotation_schedule table).  Also added extra CSS when editing course schedule 
  information.


2021-10-28
  Fixed bug in course_search module where the filter for "view courses offered" (and you select the term) was not working as expected
  in all situations, because it was not taking the school_id into account.

  Made the users module filter selection more intuitive.  For example, the school selection, and the behavior when you search
  for a particular name, while a school is selected.  Plus, made sure not to reset ALL filters if you select a letter.  For example,
  you can now select a school, and then select by letters to see the students/users in that school.  The Major pulldown also gets altered
  based on selected school.  Also changed the order of the sub tabs so that Student Users comes second.



2021-10-27
  Added a new "how to customize" folder and custom theme which inherits from fp6_clean theme.  It also includes instructions
  in a README file for copying the theme to your /custom/theme folder and overriding CSS styles.

  Added new function to make CSV strings prettier by adding a space after the comma.  Makes them break correctly in HTML.  Also
  changed term settings fields for advising settings from textfield to textarea, so you can enter more than 255 chars.
  

2021-10-24
  Added ability to designate notification recipients for when a student sends an SMS to a specific line (advisors will *always* receive
  such notifications from their advisees).  This is a setting on the admin/user page for faculty-staff members only.


2021-10-21
  Added new concept to textareas with a maxlength set.  It will now by default show the character count up to the max.

  Completed sending mass txt messages with Engagements, and getting back results in a CSV.


2021-10-20
  Made alteration to student_search so that if you have schools enabled, and search for a major within a school, you only see results for that
  school.  Also, fixed bug where if more than one school had the same major code, it was skipping over them.
  
  Fixed some malformed HTML in the user module causing placeholder text to look weird.
  
  Fixed a bug by adding permission to schools, to permit a user to edit users/students from a particular school.
  

2021-10-17
  Minor change in admin.module to fix typo.
  
  Implemented sending mass text messages function as part of the Engagements
  module.


2021-10-14
  Fixed bug in notify module, where the notification history table wasn't created.

  Added permissions on a per-phone number level for sending SMS messages.

  Engagements show which department/description the SMS was sent to or from on the main screen.


2021-10-13
  Made changes to engagements schema, so that we can track the SMS number a txt message was sent from, as well as the sms message id, in the table.

  Made change to content_versions table schema, so we have the option of saving a "log" message with the content.  This is accomplished by entering:
    $content->log = "some text here"; 
  before calling content_save($content);


2021-10-12
  Working on Engagements' ability to have multiple numbers on account they can receive SMS from.
  

2021-10-11
  Fixed bug in Engagements, where it was not showing attached files correctly from SMS.

  Changed how we handle incoming SMS messages to better catch "real time" messages.


2021-10-10
  Cleaned up code in various places.

  Fixed bug in Engagements where date_sent was not in correct format.  Also fixed old code which was causing a PHP syntax error for txt messages.

  Added function db_get_cwid_from_user_id() to db.inc file.

  Added missing function engagements_handle_incoming_sms() to engagements to stop 404 error, though at the moment this function is just
  a placeholder, and might be removed in the future.


2021-10-08
  Upon system install, correctly get the modules' schema from their .info file, so we aren't told we need to run updates right off the bat.
  

2021-10-07
  Made changes to content module, so that we keep track of each version's author (user_id), but the original
  user_id in the content table doesn't get overwritten.  This lets admin edit an existing piece of content, for example,
  without us losing track of who the original author was, or who the author is of each version.

  Added some extra CSS to Advising Screen, for the table rows containing the pie charts.  Should make it easier
  to selectively hide or show them for future CSS devs.

  
2021-10-05
  Added a "view combined" link on History for advisings of multiple terms, so you can see all the selections on
  one screen.
  
  Added new column to "advising_sessions", called "advising_session_token".  It is the same value when we advise for
  1 or more terms. It makes it easier to get a list of all the terms that were advised at the same time, and possibly can
  be useful in the future for other modules.
  

2021-10-03  
  Made it so the db updates system uses the Batch API so it won't timeout over long update jobs.
  
  Made it so that the watchdog "message" column is "longtext" instead of just "text".  Same for announcements, alerts, and other core modules' tables.
  This was to prevent users from entering more than 65kb of text in a single field, something that was indeed a possibility, especially in the watchdog
  table when debugging complex datatypes.  The decision was made to either use blob or "longtext" from now on, instead of "text", as it can store up to 
  4gb of data, with only a 2 byte increase in overhead over "text".
  
  Modified content module so we only look for content whose modules are enabled.  This was done
  to prevent a PHP warning message, and to prevent strange behavior if we tried to edit previously
  submitted content.
  
  Made minor edit to batch test routine to better illustrate how limits work.
  
  Minor tweak when loading degree to prevent PHP warning.
  
  Since "groups" is a reserved keyword in MySQL 8+, edited various files to enclose in backticks when performing sql on that table.
  

2021-09-27
  Altered weights in dashboard render array for consistency.
  

2021-09-26
  Increased weight of submit and delete buttons in content module.
  
  
2021-09-22
  Made it so custom content types' add form is automatically allowed up to 4 additional wildcards in the menu, for future module
  developers to make use of, if desired.
  
  Fixed bug in the way form submissions were handled, which caused problems if you were depending on wildcards in URL during form submission.
  
  Fixed bug in Content module where editing content for non-admin wasn't working.
  
  Fixed bug in Content module to skip over markup fields.
   

2021-09-18
  Wrapped some strings in announcements with t().
  
  Converted system dashboard to use render array system so other modules can modify it.
  
  Made it so that we can pass strings in a render array for simplicity (they appear as plain html markup)
  
  Weights in elements can be floats now, instead of only ints.
  

2021-08-19
  Made it so that What If selection screen will show grad degree options if the student belongs to a grad rank other than 'GR' by checking
  setting first.  Also re-worded the description of that school setting for clarity.
  

2021-08-18
  Fixed bug in edit groups, where it was looking for school_id in prod table, and not draft table.  Same for degrees and courses.
  

2021-08-16
  Since FireFox (as of this date) does not support the datetime-local type, I added a "shim" library where we will override the browser's behavior
  with jquery.datetimepicker, if the browser does not support it. 
  
  Removed logging of _REQUEST from when forms are submitted, as it could represent an insecure watchdog message.
  

2021-08-13
  Made alterations to the default settings.php file, to better explain certain concepts.
  
  Fixed system status page to not show %FLIGHTPATH_VERSION% as system version, if it came from git repository.  Instead
  it just shows "GitRepo".
  

2021-08-12
  Cleaned up some CSS for the permissions form (in the user module).
  
  Added "sticky" headers to permissions form to make it easier to use.
  

2021-08-11
  Added a "custom settings" area to the default settings.php which is created during the installation process.  Also changed some of the wording in the
  settings.php file, for clarity.
    

2021-08-10
  Made the access stats report look nicer.
  
  Added more logging (including WATCHDOG_DEBUG) throughout FlightPath to make it easier to track activity.
  
  Added more time to setting to keep DEBUG entries, as well as wrapped more strings in t().
  
  Made changes to stats to make it easier to add a "school select" form for reports that need it.
  
  Adjusted major students progress report to use school_id correctly.
  

2021-08-09
  Fixed bug with What If limit on selections; wasn't counting tracks correctly.
  

2021-08-08
  Added the school_id and school_code to body class when viewing students.  The idea is to help CSS developers down the road.
  
  Cleaned up some on-screen messaging when changing terms.
  
  Added "spinner" property to apply draft changes button, changed description text as well.
  
  Fixed bug in editing group definitions where it was not respecting the new setting which allows "default" courses as well.
  Also it was not properly disabling the Required Courses textarea, as it was using a String and not an Array for attributes.
  
  Made it so that when setting attributes on a form element, it must always be in the form of an array.  Updated various files
  throughout FlightPath to make sure that was the case.
  
  Added new file, cli.php.  It's a command-line-only file.  At the moment, all it can do is clear the system's cache, but more commands
  will be added eventually.
  

2021-08-06
  Added new module_enabled() function to misc, which, due to caching, will make it faster to see if a module
  is enabled or not, rather than using function_exists().  Updated various files to use this new function instead
  of function_exists()

  Added new setting to schools where courses from the "default" school can be used in non-default degrees and groups.

  Added create table instructions to enagagements.install for required tables.
   
  Modified the fp_join_assoc() and explode functions to use a separator of _S- instead of just - (since we might be sending negative numbers).
  
  Removed bug where "Substitute" tab was showing in popup even on "courses added".
  
  Removed "Required by" text/line if we are in the Courses Added block, or if we are looking at a degree with only one "degree" (not combined).
  
  Fixed bug with student_files which was preventing file uploads.
  

2021-08-05

  Added "major student progress" report to core system reports.
  
  Updated various reports (from stats module) to handle school_id in some way.
  
  Updated code to make sure school_id was supplied to key functions for determing course_id from name, as well
  as changes to prereq module to ensure school_id was supplied to key functions.
  
  Marked a couple unused methods/functions for removal by adding z__ before the name.
  
  Fixed bug in users' Faculty Advisees list, where in the comment for an advisee you couldn't see their major code correctly.
  

2021-08-04
  Removed out-of-date setting for student_search, where we can only search for majors in the current catalog year.
  
  Got rid of the course_search "report" where you can download offerings as CSV.  Should be under stats anyway.  For now,
  simply removed.
  
  Updated parts of course_search (dealing with getting syllabus) to only use course_id in queries.
  
  Updated add new degree and copy degree to pay attention to school_id.
  
  Added new icons to system, and made sure all core modules had an icon associated with them in the Admin Console.

  Added multi-school functionality to audit settings.
  
  Added multi-school functionality to course search settings.
  
  Fixed bug with upcoming appointments.
  
  If using schools, made it so the advising snapshot lets you switch between schools.
  

2021-08-03
  Added new variable_delete() function to db.inc.
  
  Added new variable_exists() function to db.inc.  Returns TRUE or FALSE if the variable is even in the variables table.
  
  Changed schools module to let us override default school settings on a *per field* level.
  
  Modified how variable_get_for_school() checks to see if we are overriding the default school's val.
  
  Modified admin's edit-advising-settings to handle multiple schools.
  
  Fixed bug where db's update_course_requirement_by_name was trying to use school_id in tables which didn't have it.


2021-08-02
  Added new menu type:  MENU_TYPE_DEFAULT_TAB. This is a tab which otherwise behaves like a MENU_TYPE_NORMAL_ITEM.
  
  Added new page_setting to menu router api:  $item['page_settings']['tab_title'] = "blah". This is an optional special string
  used just for the tab of a page, separate from it's regular title.
  
  Replaced calls to GLOBALS['fp_system_settings'] array with variable_get() where appropriate.  Cleaned up unused functions.
  
  Added school column to output for student search of advisees.
  
  Added ability to specify optgroups for options in select lists in the Form API.
  
  Added ability to search for majors within a school (if user is allowed) on the student search screen.
  
  Modified course_search to let you search by school, if schools module is enabled.

  syllabi to a more reasonable length.
  
  Added "school" column to the list of courses you can edit from course_search module. 
  
  
2021-08-01
  Deprecating fp_get_system_settings() function.  It is now better served by simple use of variable_get().
  
  Changed school setting "what_if_catalog_year" to "what_if_catalog_year_mode" to disambiguate from advising variables.
  

2021-07-31
  Removed extra files from modules that used to be contrib, but are now in core (ex: CHANGELOG files)
  
  Added school_id to primary key for table degree_college
  
  In AdvisingScreen's output_to_browser(), $page_title has tags stripped before being used as HTML tag <title>
  
  Tweaked tabs' css slightly to give a little more whitespace below tabs.

  Fixed bug where unchecked checkbox was never being saved as boolean false, and was instead being saved as NULL.  Also, wasn't working
  if inside a fieldset.
  

2021-07-30
  Fixed bug in Calendar with Upcoming Appointments still not showing "today" and "tomorrow" appointments correctly.  Went with different approach.
  
  Added ability to edit semester block numbers when editing a degree.

  Added ability to limit the number of selections on What If.  It defaults to 5.  This is to help keep students from blowing up the server by selecting
  every degree possible.
  
  Updated blank degrees (and schools) to be able to search by school.
  
  

2021-07-29
  Fixed deprecated notice.

  Added "spinner" attribute to button for confirm appointment and save.
  
  Added ICS attachment to notifications for student-initiated appointments.
  
  Removed dev code for external calendars.
  
  Added new code for caching external calendars for at least 5 minutes, to save frequent lookups.

2021-07-28

  Added ability to handle attachments to fp_mail(), as well as string attachments to smtp module.
  
  Added ability to send attachments (string method) with notifications by email.
  
  Added new property that can be added to form elements (like submit buttons), "spinner" => TRUE.  This
  will cause a spinning graphic to appear when the button is pressed, and the button to disable itself so it
  cannot be pressed more than once.
  
  Made it so all "content" forms use the spinner property for their submit buttons.
  

2021-07-27
  Implemented check when searching for students, to make sure user has correct permissions to search for student in particular school.
  
  Added ability to trim only DEBUG messages from the watchdog.

2021-07-25
  Configured blank degrees to make use of the render system (so other modules can make changes more easily)
  

2021-07-23
  Added a few more details to render array in AdvisingScreen, when drawing course rows.  Also added argument to include the group a course is assigned to, if applicable, to
  draw_course_row().  This also helps the render engine and any modules which need it.
  

2021-07-14
  Fixed bug where form_error's was messing up markup_no_wrappers elements.

  Added extra validation on degree edit form, so that it stops you from adding a duplicate group with mismatched type or min hours.  Also made it
  so you can delete such a group.
  

2021-07-12
  Made it more clear that the currently used SMS service in Engagements is "SignalWire".  Also made sure that emails processed by Engagements were deleted after
  they were parsed, so they do not fill up the email server's Trash folder.
  

2021-07-11
  Fixed bug in engagements module where it was looking for a table which does not exist.
  
  Made it so when an appointment (with Zoom) is cancelled, it also deletes the Zoom meeting from zoom's servers.


2021-07-10
  Removed page titles from the Student search pages/forms.
  
  Added new CSS for printing.
  
  Added ability to add classes to collapsible fieldsets.
  

2021-07-09
  Implemented handling of numeric grades in FlightPath.  Basically, they must be converted to letter grades at the time
  they are assigned.  There is also now a new field in Course:  db_grade.  This is the actual grade as it is stored in the
  the database.
  
  
 
2021-07-08
  Cleaning up code, adding more content to render array system.  Cleaning up malformed HTML.
  
  Continuing work on themeing and rendering system.
   
 
2021-07-07
  Converted advise_display_view to use render array system. 
  
  Changed when drawing course rows, no longer hard-coding widths, styles, align, etc.
  elements.  Instead, we are relying entirely only CSS classes for styling.
 
 
2021-07-06 
  Converted AdvisingScreen::displaySemester to using render array system.

  For markup elements in the form_api, if type is not explicitly set to "markup", and is left blank,
  then the default will be "markup_no_wrappers", which means no wrapping divs will be used. 
  
  Converted AdvisingScreen::draw_course_row to use render array system.
  
  Fixed bug where remainder of course requirement (after partial sub) wasn't sorting correctly when using 
  the "sort by database id" setting.
  
  Fixed bug in Substitution tab, where split sub "pieces" were not showing the correct number of hours.
   


2021-07-02
  Modified Calendar module so that event types can be sheduled for longer durations (up to 2 hrs), have longer buffers (up to 2hrs) and have longer "prevent within" times
  (up to 24 hours).
  
  Added more literal strings to t() so they can be translated.
   

2021-06-28
  Made change in content_content_load(), to make sure that when we load based on cid, we order by vid DESC, to make
  sure we always get the most recent version.
  
  Fixed code in student_search, where the "include inactive students" checkbox was being ignored.  Also changed settings
  for extra conditions to add to query.
  
  Made changes to the way Student Profile hook works, so that other modules can more easily add to the list, and modify existing
  entries if desired.
  
  Fixed bug where recommended and hidden courses were not behaving correctly in groups.  Worked in Blank Degrees but not in What If or 
  on the actual degree plan.

  Added new field to calendar's appointment content type, to keep up with video meeting data.
  
  Fixed typo in the content.module (misspelling of word).
    

2021-06-23
  Instead of passing the session_id during redirect, we now pass a "fp_session_str" which contains
  a method of validating the session_id, to make sure it is not a hacker attempting to imitate a valid
  session.  This was accomplished by new functions in misc.inc and checking in index.php before we
  trust the session_id in the URL.
  
  

2021-06-22
  Fixed bug in user module where adding a new faculty user caused mysql error.
  
  Added a backtrace (like we do for MySQL errors) to the PHP error handler in misc.inc.  Also adding to watchdog
  when we get a warning or error from the handler.
  
  Changed the way cookies are unset on logout, to fix an issue where they were not being unset correctly, but also
  to handle possible array notation in the cookie names.  See system.module
  
  Made changes to watchdog severity level for certain types of data, in anticipation of a module which would delete, for example,
  "WATCHDOG_DEBUG" entries after X amount of time, since they are the least important.  Also made changes to the PHP error handler
  so it correctly identifies in the watchdog whether it was a PHP error or warning, and adjusts the severity constant accordingly.
  
  Fixed typo in user settings pulldown menu.
  
  Made it so if you are not logged in, the left sidebar menu shows a link to the login page.
  

2021-06-17
  Fixed small typo in form_error() message when rejecting a saved degree.
  
  In student_search module, got rid of the "majors"-related permissions.  Also cleaned up code which had been commented out.
  

2021-06-16
  Adding in new setting to disable all student logins (unless whitelisted).  It's in the System Settings form.

  Added is_disabled and last_login to fields in the user object.

  Added new hook to allow easy manipulation of student profile items in the "currently advising" box at top of screen.

  Changing user_settings to be a key/value pair type table, making it easy to add new settings in the future.

  Created new table called "user_attributes", and it's used the same as user_settings.  This lets us store details about
  a student, for example, if they are an athlete or student worker, etc, w/o having to hard-code any values.  We are removing the
  student_attributes and faculty_attributes tables at the same time; user_attributes will replace both tables.
  
  

2021-06-15
  Added more literal strings to t() function so they can be translated.
  

2021-06-13
  Changed system.install so that institution_id is a 100 varchar in the database, instead of 10.  Also made `name` an index for transfer_institutions table.
  
  Removed some default character set and collation vals from .install scripts, as this can cause a problem in MySQL 8+.
  
  Removed apply_draft_changes logic from schools module, since no longer needed and causing error.  Cleaned up old code.  Made sure
  What If mode only showed correct degrees based on the students' school.
  
  Added logic in schools and admin.degrees.inc when copying a degree, make sure to keep up with school id.
  
  Fixed Duplicate entire catalog year function to also respect school_id.
  

2021-06-12
  Working on schools functionlity for groups & definitions.
  
  Fixed a bug where icon filename field was no longer visible when editing degrees.
  
  Tweaks to popup which displays the degrees using group.
  
  Added a confirm dialog when changing schools, since it could cause all sorts of problems.
  
  Watchdog insert was failing because anon user school_id was null; wasn't being intval'd.

  Fixing PHP warning in system_init().

2021-06-11
  Added _validate function when editing a degree, so we can test for school mis-match.  Also fixed a bug where if there was more than one
  form_error() for the same element, it wouldn't display the red border around that element.  Also made it so that markup fields
  can also have form_error called on them.


2021-06-10
  Added ability to have group requirements (in degrees) with fractional hours.  Ex: 0.5 hours or 1.2 hours, etc.  Previously,
  when a group was loaded, the hours_required field was being intval()'d.  Changed to floatval().
  
  Fixed bug where course descriptions were not being cached correctly due to a typo.
  
  Wrapped "hours" and "hrs" with t() function so those words can be translated to "credits" if need be in a hook_translate function.

  Fixed bug where group couldn't be deleted from degree plan due to school_id being set.
  
  Worked on courses issues with schools.
  

2021-06-07
  Added schools select list option for user forms, made other cosmetic changes.
  
  Changed users module so that you can enter DEPT_CODE along with department.  Change table schema so that
  college, dept_code, and deparment are varchar 255.  Will use a machine name version of department if no DEPT_CODE
  is entered.
  
  Found a bug on the dashboard (system.module), where it states what day it is.  I was using strtotime("today"), which apparently
  was causing issues due to timezone conversions.  Switched it to time() and that fixed the issue.
  

2021-06-06
  Finishing up users screen for school id, both faculty and students.  Also added filter options to make it look
  more consistent.  Added pager to student users screen, since we might theoretically load the entire student
  list, both past and present.  It shows 30 at a time now.
  

2021-06-04
  Working on courses with new school_id.  Changed appearance of courses screen to look more like the other degree
  edit pages.  Made better use of tables and highlighting when you mouse over a row.  Added a filter form like others
  as well.
  

2021-06-03
  Added new schools filter option to degrees, and working on groups.  Filters on degrees list now actually
  a form (and added new form to groups) so other modules can modify with hook_form_alter if desired.  Right now,
  it's only really for the schools module.
  

2021-06-01
  Fixed bug in pager_query which was sometimes throwing numbers off.  Expanded functionality of the paget_query function.
  
  More work on school_id system, amending the need in some tables.  Decided to declare that CWIDs *must be unique* in FlightPath.
  Therefore, the users table will be the only place that a user's school_id is stored.
  
  Changed wording on user module, which stated CWID had to be numeric.  It does not.


2021-05-31
  Adding school_id to api and queries throughout FlightPath.
  

2021-05-27
  Changing some style issues when listing multiple degrees for a student.
  
  Change wording for select of tracks if you are required to select a certain number of tracks for a degree.
  
  Fixed bug where you couldn't override a semester block title unless you also had a course.
  

2021-05-25
  Added schools module to core, and made changes to system.install as well as other .install files, so that tables
  now have a school_id field and needed keys.
  

2021-05-16
  Added lots of changes to student search. We now can see Academic Priority.  Uses pager query and table sort as well.  No
  more limit on 300 students, since we can do pager.  Made table headers responsive, as well as priority vals.


2021-05-11
  Added ability to have custom logout messages.
  

2021-05-09
  Added "last_login" column to users table, and to users screen in admin console.  Also make it so the "contact FlightPath production team" link
  does not appear if no email address is entered.
  

2021-05-05
  In the school settings form, you may now choose to sort courses in degrees and groups not by alphabetical, but by the order
  in which they were entered.


2021-05-04
  Added fields to groups and group_requirements tables (incl. draft_) to facilitate public notes in groups,
  as well as "attributes" on a per-requirement level.
  
  Changed popup description to use fp_alert() function, with base64 encoding so we don't have to worry
  about trouble characters, and can enter HTML as well.
  

2021-04-21

  Fixed unavailable times table to look cleaner and easier to understand.
