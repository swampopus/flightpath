FlightPath Changelog
====================

2012-06-05
  Worked with course_search module.  It has now merged with the courseinfoentry module.  Removed
  the courseinfoentry module as a result.
  

2012-06-04
  Removed old references to SESSION["user_type"], replaced with newer check on permissions instead
  
  Renamed old files to have a z__ in front of filename, in preparation to delete.
  
  Popup contact/report a bug is now part of the system module, not its own php file.
  
  Removed references to old admin_debug statement.  Also cleaned up some old comments along
  the way.
  
  Added blank_degrees module and reworked various bits of code to make it work.
   

2012-05-28
  Made sure user has access to submit a form after they've submitted.
  
  Refined permissions, made sure permissions were working correctly for tabs.
  
  Tabs don't show if you don't have permission.
  
  Worked on "student" view, when they can only see their own degree plan.
  
  Fixed bug where show/hide pie charts stopped working.
  
  Login form is now a proper "fp" form, so it can have
  custom submitters/validators
  
  Created hook_user_login and hook_user_logout
  
  Made fpm() function VERY fancy, with click-to-open
  folding, like Krumo.  Great for debugging.
  
  Blocks don't show up if there is no content in the body.  

2012-05-24
  Removing the concept of the separate flightpath_extra_data database
  
  Switched datetime field type to "posted" timestamp integer in tables
  
  Added idea of validate_handlers to forms, like in Drupal.

2012-05-21
  Created Blocks module, and method of establishing block regions and blocks offered by a module.

2012-05-19
  Working on modules page. Installing, enabling, uninstalling, etc.  Created system
  of hooks that go in a .install file, like Drupal.
  
  Created various other enhancements to admin, uncluding user management and roles.

2012-04-21
  Enabled small search box in corner.

2012-04-15
  Print view working, change terms, change tracks

2012-04-13
  Added ability to change tracks & terms on Degree Plans.

2012-04-12
  Finished the History tab

2012-04-11
  Worked more on Admin, the variable system, and converting the concept of System variables
  over to the variable system, to eliminate the extra "settings" tables which are unneeded.

2012-04-01
  Created permissions page, where users can set which rolls have which permissions.
  

2012-03-31
  Added Rolls management page to admin module.


2012-03-25
  Still workin on admin module.
  Focusing on the Groups section.
  
  Got changing icon working for edit-group page.
  
  Got definitions working on the edit-group page.
  
  Add new group and delete group works.
  
  Fixed bug where groups did not redirect to exactly the correct URL by default.
  
  Process all group definitions now works.
  
  Editing/Adding/Deleting courses now fully works.
  
  Apply draft changes done


2012-03-24
  Still working on admin module.
  
  Can now add new degree plans.
  
  Implemented a new, more robust Form API system similar
  to Drupal.  You can have "required" fields, which
  automatically fail validation if no value is entered.
  
  Automatically looks for a callback_submit() function to submit to; no need
  to register a new menu hook.
  
  Have a new "form_error" function which creates an error
  message for your form. 
  
  Can now "copy" a degree plan.  I believe this basically completes the degrees portion
  of the admin section.
  
  Made some tweaks to the menus, so that in Admin there are tabs now to help the user
  keep track of what screen they are looking at.
  
  Starting on "groups" for Admin.
  
  Created concepts of "popup_description" instead of just "description" in the form_api.
  This causes a [?] link to appear in the label of the element, and, which clicked,
  will popup the text therein.  It makes forms a bit more tidy.
  
  Have basic editing of groups mostly complete.
  

2012-03-23
  Continuing work on admin module.
  
  Can actually save degrees now, and add/remove elective groups
  
  Fixed some minor tweaks to make sure it scrolled back to the correct position.
  
  Changed the way the "menu_links" array is set up in the menu items, to allow for
  more flexibility in the future.
  
  Invented a new hook.  hook_menu_handle_replacement_pattern ($st).  It will
  let you pass things like de_catalog_year=%DE_CATALOG_YEAR% to the l() function,
  which will then look for that hook to give each module the chance to act on that replacement
  pattern.
  

2012-03-18
  Continued work on admin module.
  
  Got much of the Edit Degrees displaying correctly.  At this point, have not yet wired
  it up so that you can submit changes to degree plans.


2012-03-16
  Beginning work on the Admin module today.  I expect it to be huge and complicated.
 
  Urgent message Save/Load
 
  Created simple Form API similar to Drupal (but much simpler)
 
  Created a concept of a system_settings_form which automatically writes values to the variables
  table upon save, so you don't have to create your own submit handler for forms.  Ideal for little
  one-form settings pages.
 
  New "page_setting" for menu items: menu_links.  Provides a way to place "breadcrumbs" and other
  types of links at the top of the page automatically.
 

2012-03-15
  Finished up (mostly) Comments module.
  
  Did work on getting access callback system working with permissions.  


2012-03-12
  Got switching between Year view and Type view working.

  Got What If working (I think).  Its a little bit screwy, and sometimes it seems to break when
  it wants to, but it seems to be OK for the time being.

  
2012-03-11
  Got many of the popups working on the "View" page.  Also, submitting a basic advising session works.
  
  Moved over all of the Javascript into its own file (advise.js) instead of being locked up inside the
  AdvisingScreen object.  It could be further split out into other files as well.
  
  Adding/Removing Substitutions, and removing courses from a degree plan, appear to be working
  correctly.
  
  Menus can specify a file to load as needed.  Like an additional .inc file where that page_callback is located.

  Admin toolbox and hide/show pie charts
  
  Got rid of XML in FlightPath.  Now, we just serialize or nothing.  No sense in the extra overhead.  Still need to get rid of it
  for module.info files.  Some are still .xml.  Will get to that when I do the Admin work. 
  

2012-03-10
  Continuing work on making FP more like Drupal.
  
  Created "modules" table to better keep track of modules.
  
  Created student_search module.  Working on bringing in all of its functionality.
  
  Added jquery 1.7.1 instead of 1.3.2.
  
  Added much of the Advise module
  
  Have a new concept of passing around the "current_student_id" from page to page,
  and saving all other "advising variables" to a table, rather than keeping them in the POST
  between every page.  This makes it much more tidy.
  

2012-03-09
  ** BIG CHANGE **
  I ran a script to convert from camelCase to underscore_style.
  Now, only Class names are CamelCased.  Everything else-- variables and methods and functions,
  are all going to be underscore_style (also called K&R or C++ style).
  Even though I think this isn't as pretty, it is consistent, which is what I am more
  concerned about.
  
  Fixed numerous capitalization problems.  I'm sure there's more after this.
  
  Gave important system_settings default values.
  
  Moved functions.php into other .inc files, in a new "includes" directory.


2012-03-08
  Fixed a bug where definitions in groups, once entered could not be removed.
  
  Adjusted default.settings.php file to have error reporting limited by default,
  as well as additional instructions for setting up through Windows.
  
  Added "user_auth" table to flightpath database.  Implemented default login
  attempts to that table (empty it to override and use another method)
   - Created "admin" user by default.  user_id = 1, password = fpadminuser
   
  Made it so the number of courses to load (and cache) on login is configurable
  in the settings.
  
  Added menu_rebuild_cache(), pretty_print(), and db_query()
  
  Making other numerous changes, to make FlightPath more like Drupal.
  
  Changing naming convention to underscore style instead of camelCase,
  when not dealing with an object.
  
  Made a lot of progress in getting the primary display of course_search module
  to use the new menu system (piped through ?q=location/etc

--- v3.1.1

2012-01-03
  Cleaned up queries in admin.php to use new replacement pattern system.

2011-12-22
  Modified queries throughout the various classes and php files to 
  use new replacement pattern system, to make them less
  vulnerable to SQL-injection attacks.

2011-11-25
  Created new replacement pattern system for DatabaseHandler::dbQuery function,
  to help protect against SQL-injection attacks.

--- v3.1

7-14-2011
  FlightPath is now capable of handling courses with 0 hours.
  It actually, internally, tracks them as 1 hour courses, but
  displays them as 0 hour courses.  The pseudo-hour which is 
  attributed to it is known as a "Ghost hour" in the system.

5-4-2011
  Fixed a small bug relating to degree options.  If a student
  has a particular option selected, then changes catalog years,
  and that option (track code) no longer exists, then FP was just
  display no degree plan.  It will now default back to the
  base degree plan.


--- v3.0.1b

4-11-2011
  Made "deCanSwitchUsers" be its own permission, instead
  of simply testing for full_admin status.
  
  Made theme change to remove "ULM" from the default banner image.

--- v3.0b ---

4-8-2011
  This is the initial release of FlightPath as open source,
  debuting as version 3.0b.
