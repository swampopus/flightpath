FlightPath Changelog
====================

Fixed a bug where definitions in groups, once entered could not be removed.

Adjusted default.settings.php file to have error reporting limited by default,
as well as additional instructions for setting up through Windows.

Added "user_auth" table to flightpath database.  Implemented default login
attempts to that table (empty it to override and use another method)
 - Created "admin" user by default.  user_id = 1, password = fpadminuser
 
Made it so the number of courses to load (and cache) on login is configurable
in the settings.

Added menu_rebuild_cache(), pretty_print(), and db_query()

Making other numerous changes, to make FlightPath more like Drupal.

Changing naming convention to underscore style instead of camelCase,
when not dealing with an object.

FlightPath is now capable of handling courses with 0 hours.
It actually, internally, tracks them as 1 hour courses, but
displays them as 0 hour courses.  The pseudo-hour which is 
attributed to it is known as a "Ghost hour" in the system.

5-4-2011
Fixed a small bug relating to degree options.  If a student
has a particular option selected, then changes catalog years,
and that option (track code) no longer exists, then FP was just
display no degree plan.  It will now default back to the
base degree plan.
