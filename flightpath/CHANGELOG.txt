  global one).
  

2016-02-13
  Fixed bug in install script so that track major codes can have up to 20 characters.
  
  Modified the add degree form, to check to make sure tracks and major codes don't contain spaces,
  as well as fall below the 20 character limit.

  and it presented a possible security issue on improperly secured servers.
  

2016-01-19

  one which ships with D7.
