FlightPath 7.x Changelog
========================

2024-10-04
  Modified Engagements display so that engagements are sorted by activity_datetime desc FIRST, then by vid DESC.  Otherwise, this
  caused a bug where the most recently modified was appearing first.
  
  Modified Engagements display so that emails show their subject line.


2024-09-30
  Fixing bug when receiving SMS, where it wasn't sending full contents of SMS to non-advisor users, if set.
  
  Made a non-breaking change to modules_implement_hook() function, so we can specified modules to skip when
  checking to see which ones implement a hook.
  
  Made changes to the order in which content is loaded and saved, to make sure content is fully created before
  being passed to a hook.
  
  Added alerts_content_load() hook to alerts module, so if there are attached media we will show them in the
  alert, similar to email and text messages.


2024-09-19
  Added server hostname to the PHP mail errors email.
    
  Cleaning up some code in the batch module.
  

2024-09-05
  Created a convenience function and added it to misc.inc: array_get().  This lets you get a value from an array (if it exists), or,
  if it does not exist, you get back an empty string ("") or whatever you specify.  
  This is helpful for the common PHP warning in PHP 8 of an "undefined array key".  My intention is to slowly replace the $x = @$arr['something'] type
  statements with $x = array_get($arr, 'something') over time.  All those @'s are ugly.
  
  Modified cron.php to make it slightly more secure in how it checks for the cron token. 
  

2024-09-04
  Various tweaks for PHP 8.
  
  Added option in Engagements - SMS Settings, to allow the full contents of an SMS message to be sent to specified recipients, instead of a simple
  notification that they should log in to view.
  
  Removed a line from .htaccess which was affecting cookies and being able to open links to FlightPath from emails.  
  

2024-08-30
  Made an extra check to make sure there is an .htaccess file in the "private" files directory. If not, one is created.


2024-08-27
  In engagements module, added "image/jpg" to list of accepted mime types for incoming sms/email, even though *officially* 
  that mime type is invalid.  It should only ever be "image/jpeg".  This is to accomodate incoming sms/emails which don't follow the official rules.
  

2024-08-22
  Fixed bug in system where if a disallowed student rank was trying to log in, the message displayed didn't show what ranks *were* allowed in.
    

2024-08-21
  Fixed bug in engagements module, where we were checking for calls.  It was not correctly requesting the calls, and was therefor getting
  *every* call in the account history on every cron run.  Fixed that, and simplified what gets added to the watchdog.
  

2024-08-06
  Fixed bug in system.module where mfa verification codes were being deleted every cron run, instead of
  (at most) once per hour.


2024-08-04
  Minor tweaks for PHP 8.
  
  Updated information in lassie module's readme file.
  

2024-08-03
  Updated logic for incoming SMS messages in engagements module.  It now verifies the message came from SignalWire correctly.
  

2024-08-02
  SignalWire will send an MMS's body as a media attachment.  Changing how we receive that in the engagements module.
  
  Also updating prices in the engagements module to better match SignalWire's.
    

2024-07-30
  Fixed bug in course_search where anticipated availability was not showing correctly in PHP 8, since "" no longer equals integer 0.
  

2024-07-23
  Fixed a bug in Engagements where the "Engagements Received" list (under the Alerts screen) was not showing the pager
  correctly.
  
  Also corrected timezone not being factored in on the above mentioned screen.
  
  If a student's name cannot be found because they aren't in the "students" table, we will show their name from the "users"
  table on their profile, with an alert icon.
