  Various changes and fixes to remove warnings for PHP 8.2
  

2024-03-20
  To fix XSS vulnerability, modified Content module to disallow dangerous HTML (like script tags)
  in titles.


2024-03-15
  Fixed various deprecated warnings for PHP 8.2.
  
  Fixed issue where substitutions were no longer working, due to changes in how PHP 8.2
  compares numbers and strings.
  
  Added new function fp_trim(), which is meant to act as a drop-in replacement for trim(),
  except that it can accept NULL or FALSE and return ''.  Regular trim() cannot do this
  without triggering a deprecated warning.

  Continuing to clean code of deprecated an warning messages.
  
  Added a more robust UID when sending calendar invites, to better ensure uniqueness.
 
  DatabaseHandler->get_student_name() returns "Unknown Student" if it cannot find the student.

  Had an issue where if a hidden form variable (using FAPI) was '0', then it was not correctly
  being handled in the Content module.
