  Added code so that PHP errors collect in a temporary file, then get emailed as a digest once per cron run.
  
  When executing PHP code from the Admin Console, warnings are not suppressed with @.  This allows for testing
  error handling.

  Added new system setting, allowing the trimming of ERROR messages from the watchdog table based on age.
  
  Made changes to other files for warnings generated by PHP 8.2.

  the "report contact" form.

  in titles.

  Fixed various deprecated warnings for PHP 8.2.
  
  Fixed issue where substitutions were no longer working, due to changes in how PHP 8.2
  compares numbers and strings.
  
  Added new function fp_trim(), which is meant to act as a drop-in replacement for trim(),
