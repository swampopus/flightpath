FlightPath 6.x Changelog
========================

2021-10-03  
  Made it so the db updates system uses the Batch API so it won't timeout over long update jobs.
  
  Made it so that the watchdog "message" column is "longtext" instead of just "text".  Same for announcements, alerts, and other core modules' tables.
  This was to prevent users from entering more than 65kb of text in a single field, something that was indeed a possibility, especially in the watchdog
  table when debugging complex datatypes.  The decision was made to either use blob or "longtext" from now on, instead of "text", as it can store up to 
  4gb of data, with only a 2 byte increase in overhead over "text".
  
  Modified content module so we only look for content whose modules are enabled.  This was done
  to prevent a PHP warning message, and to prevent strange behavior if we tried to edit previously
  submitted content.
  
  Made minor edit to batch test routine to better illustrate how limits work.
  

2021-09-27
  Altered weights in dashboard render array for consistency.
  

2021-09-26
  Increased weight of submit and delete buttons in content module.
  
  
2021-09-22
  Made it so custom content types' add form is automatically allowed up to 4 additional wildcards in the menu, for future module
  developers to make use of, if desired.
  
  Fixed bug in the way form submissions were handled, which caused problems if you were depending on wildcards in URL during form submission.
  
  Fixed bug in Content module where editing content for non-admin wasn't working.
  
  Fixed bug in Content module to skip over markup fields.
   

2021-09-18
  Wrapped some strings in announcements with t().
  
  Converted system dashboard to use render array system so other modules can modify it.
  
  Made it so that we can pass strings in a render array for simplicity (they appear as plain html markup)
  
  Weights in elements can be floats now, instead of only ints.
  

2021-08-19
  Made it so that What If selection screen will show grad degree options if the student belongs to a grad rank other than 'GR' by checking
  setting first.  Also re-worded the description of that school setting for clarity.
  

2021-08-18
  Fixed bug in edit groups, where it was looking for school_id in prod table, and not draft table.  Same for degrees and courses.
  

2021-08-16
  Since FireFox (as of this date) does not support the datetime-local type, I added a "shim" library where we will override the browser's behavior
  with jquery.datetimepicker, if the browser does not support it. 
  
  Removed logging of _REQUEST from when forms are submitted, as it could represent an insecure watchdog message.
  

2021-08-13
  Made alterations to the default settings.php file, to better explain certain concepts.
  
  Fixed system status page to not show %FLIGHTPATH_VERSION% as system version, if it came from git repository.  Instead
  it just shows "GitRepo".
  

2021-08-12
  Cleaned up some CSS for the permissions form (in the user module).
  
  Added "sticky" headers to permissions form to make it easier to use.
  

2021-08-11
  Added a "custom settings" area to the default settings.php which is created during the installation process.  Also changed some of the wording in the
  settings.php file, for clarity.
    

2021-08-10
  Made the access stats report look nicer.
  
  Added more logging (including WATCHDOG_DEBUG) throughout FlightPath to make it easier to track activity.
  
  Added more time to setting to keep DEBUG entries, as well as wrapped more strings in t().
  
  Made changes to stats to make it easier to add a "school select" form for reports that need it.
  
  Adjusted major students progress report to use school_id correctly.
  

2021-08-09
  Fixed bug with What If limit on selections; wasn't counting tracks correctly.
  

2021-08-08
  Added the school_id and school_code to body class when viewing students.  The idea is to help CSS developers down the road.
  
  Cleaned up some on-screen messaging when changing terms.
  
  Added "spinner" property to apply draft changes button, changed description text as well.
  
  Fixed bug in editing group definitions where it was not respecting the new setting which allows "default" courses as well.
  Also it was not properly disabling the Required Courses textarea, as it was using a String and not an Array for attributes.
  
  Made it so that when setting attributes on a form element, it must always be in the form of an array.  Updated various files
  throughout FlightPath to make sure that was the case.
  
  Added new file, cli.php.  It's a command-line-only file.  At the moment, all it can do is clear the system's cache, but more commands
  will be added eventually.
  

2021-08-06
  Added new module_enabled() function to misc, which, due to caching, will make it faster to see if a module
  is enabled or not, rather than using function_exists().  Updated various files to use this new function instead
  of function_exists()

  Added new setting to schools where courses from the "default" school can be used in non-default degrees and groups.

  Added create table instructions to enagagements.install for required tables.
   
  Modified the fp_join_assoc() and explode functions to use a separator of _S- instead of just - (since we might be sending negative numbers).
  
  Removed bug where "Substitute" tab was showing in popup even on "courses added".
  
  Removed "Required by" text/line if we are in the Courses Added block, or if we are looking at a degree with only one "degree" (not combined).
  
  Fixed bug with student_files which was preventing file uploads.
  

2021-08-05

  Added "major student progress" report to core system reports.
  
  Updated various reports (from stats module) to handle school_id in some way.
  
  Updated code to make sure school_id was supplied to key functions for determing course_id from name, as well
  as changes to prereq module to ensure school_id was supplied to key functions.
  
  Marked a couple unused methods/functions for removal by adding z__ before the name.
  
  Fixed bug in users' Faculty Advisees list, where in the comment for an advisee you couldn't see their major code correctly.
  

2021-08-04
  Removed out-of-date setting for student_search, where we can only search for majors in the current catalog year.
  
  Got rid of the course_search "report" where you can download offerings as CSV.  Should be under stats anyway.  For now,
  simply removed.
  
  Updated parts of course_search (dealing with getting syllabus) to only use course_id in queries.
  
  Updated add new degree and copy degree to pay attention to school_id.
  
  Added new icons to system, and made sure all core modules had an icon associated with them in the Admin Console.
  
  Changed the way we denote that we are NOT overriding a core variable.  Instead of deleting from table, we mark it as 'no'
  
  Added multi-school functionality to audit settings.
  
  Added multi-school functionality to course search settings.
  
  Fixed bug with upcoming appointments.
  
  If using schools, made it so the advising snapshot lets you switch between schools.
  

2021-08-03
  Added new variable_delete() function to db.inc.
  
  Added new variable_exists() function to db.inc.  Returns TRUE or FALSE if the variable is even in the variables table.
  
  Changed schools module to let us override default school settings on a *per field* level.
  
  Modified how variable_get_for_school() checks to see if we are overriding the default school's val.
  
  Modified admin's edit-advising-settings to handle multiple schools.
  
  Fixed bug where db's update_course_requirement_by_name was trying to use school_id in tables which didn't have it.


2021-08-02
  Added new menu type:  MENU_TYPE_DEFAULT_TAB. This is a tab which otherwise behaves like a MENU_TYPE_NORMAL_ITEM.
  
  Added new page_setting to menu router api:  $item['page_settings']['tab_title'] = "blah". This is an optional special string
  used just for the tab of a page, separate from it's regular title.
  
  Replaced calls to GLOBALS['fp_system_settings'] array with variable_get() where appropriate.  Cleaned up unused functions.
  
  Added school column to output for student search of advisees.
  
  Added ability to specify optgroups for options in select lists in the Form API.

  syllabi to a more reasonable length.
  
  Added "school" column to the list of courses you can edit from course_search module. 
  
  
2021-08-01
  Deprecating fp_get_system_settings() function.  It is now better served by simple use of variable_get().
  
  Changed school setting "what_if_catalog_year" to "what_if_catalog_year_mode" to disambiguate from advising variables.
  

2021-07-31
  Removed extra files from modules that used to be contrib, but are now in core (ex: CHANGELOG files)
  
  Added school_id to primary key for table degree_college
  
  In AdvisingScreen's output_to_browser(), $page_title has tags stripped before being used as HTML tag <title>
  
  Tweaked tabs' css slightly to give a little more whitespace below tabs.

  Fixed bug where unchecked checkbox was never being saved as boolean false, and was instead being saved as NULL.  Also, wasn't working
  if inside a fieldset.
  

2021-07-30
  Fixed bug in Calendar with Upcoming Appointments still not showing "today" and "tomorrow" appointments correctly.  Went with different approach.
  
  Added ability to edit semester block numbers when editing a degree.

  Added ability to limit the number of selections on What If.  It defaults to 5.  This is to help keep students from blowing up the server by selecting
  every degree possible.
  
  Updated blank degrees (and schools) to be able to search by school.
  
  

2021-07-29
  Fixed deprecated notice.
  
  Calendar bug left in from dev-- it was not preventing students from clicking "back" and saving a second time.
  
  Added "spinner" attribute to button for confirm appointment and save.
  
  Added ICS attachment to notifications for student-initiated appointments.
  
  Removed dev code for external calendars.
  
  Added new code for caching external calendars for at least 5 minutes, to save frequent lookups.
  
  Added new code for Course objects, to keep track of all the semesters it appears in.  Good for combo-degrees.
  

2021-07-28
  Fixed bug in calendar's upcoming appointments tab, wasn't showing date ranges correctly for timezones.
  
  Added ability to handle attachments to fp_mail(), as well as string attachments to smtp module.
  
  Added ability to send attachments (string method) with notifications by email.
  
  Added new property that can be added to form elements (like submit buttons), "spinner" => TRUE.  This
  will cause a spinning graphic to appear when the button is pressed, and the button to disable itself so it
  cannot be pressed more than once.
  
  Made it so all "content" forms use the spinner property for their submit buttons.
  

2021-07-27
  Implemented check when searching for students, to make sure user has correct permissions to search for student in particular school.
  
  Added ability to trim only DEBUG messages from the watchdog.

  Added ability to have external CSS files.  This is now a setting in System Settings, under the theme section.

  Set a default icon (major.gif) for new groups.
  
  Added "upcoming appointments" tab to the Calendar page, which displays events which are approaching.
  

2021-07-25
  Configured blank degrees to make use of the render system (so other modules can make changes more easily)
  

2021-07-23
  Added a few more details to render array in AdvisingScreen, when drawing course rows.  Also added argument to include the group a course is assigned to, if applicable, to
  draw_course_row().  This also helps the render engine and any modules which need it.
  

2021-07-14
  Fixed bug where form_error's was messing up markup_no_wrappers elements.

  Added extra validation on degree edit form, so that it stops you from adding a duplicate group with mismatched type or min hours.  Also made it
  so you can delete such a group.
  

2021-07-12
  Made it more clear that the currently used SMS service in Engagements is "SignalWire".  Also made sure that emails processed by Engagements were deleted after
  they were parsed, so they do not fill up the email server's Trash folder.
  

2021-07-11
  Fixed bug in engagements module where it was looking for a table which does not exist.
  
  Made it so when an appointment (with Zoom) is cancelled, it also deletes the Zoom meeting from zoom's servers.


2021-07-10
  Removed page titles from the Student search pages/forms.
  
  Added new CSS for printing.
  
  Added ability to add classes to collapsible fieldsets.
  

2021-07-09
  Implemented handling of numeric grades in FlightPath.  Basically, they must be converted to letter grades at the time
  they are assigned.  There is also now a new field in Course:  db_grade.  This is the actual grade as it is stored in the
  the database.
  
  
 
2021-07-08
  Cleaning up code, adding more content to render array system.  Cleaning up malformed HTML.
  
  Continuing work on themeing and rendering system.
   
 
2021-07-07
  Converted advise_display_view to use render array system. 
  
  Changed when drawing course rows, no longer hard-coding widths, styles, align, etc.
  elements.  Instead, we are relying entirely only CSS classes for styling.
 
 
2021-07-06 
  Converted AdvisingScreen::displaySemester to using render array system.

  For markup elements in the form_api, if type is not explicitly set to "markup", and is left blank,
  then the default will be "markup_no_wrappers", which means no wrapping divs will be used. 
  
  Converted AdvisingScreen::draw_course_row to use render array system.
  
  Fixed bug where remainder of course requirement (after partial sub) wasn't sorting correctly when using 
  the "sort by database id" setting.
  
  Fixed bug in Substitution tab, where split sub "pieces" were not showing the correct number of hours.
   


2021-07-02
  Modified Calendar module so that event types can be sheduled for longer durations (up to 2 hrs), have longer buffers (up to 2hrs) and have longer "prevent within" times
  (up to 24 hours).
  
  Added more literal strings to t() so they can be translated.
   

2021-06-28
  Made change in content_content_load(), to make sure that when we load based on cid, we order by vid DESC, to make
  sure we always get the most recent version.
  
  Fixed code in student_search, where the "include inactive students" checkbox was being ignored.  Also changed settings
  for extra conditions to add to query.
  
  Made changes to the way Student Profile hook works, so that other modules can more easily add to the list, and modify existing
  entries if desired.
  
  Fixed bug where recommended and hidden courses were not behaving correctly in groups.  Worked in Blank Degrees but not in What If or 
  on the actual degree plan.
  

2021-06-26
  Added new field to calendar's appointment content type, to keep up with video meeting data.
  
  Fixed typo in the content.module (misspelling of word).
    

2021-06-23
  Instead of passing the session_id during redirect, we now pass a "fp_session_str" which contains
  a method of validating the session_id, to make sure it is not a hacker attempting to imitate a valid
  session.  This was accomplished by new functions in misc.inc and checking in index.php before we
  trust the session_id in the URL.
  
  

2021-06-22
  Fixed bug in user module where adding a new faculty user caused mysql error.
  
  Added a backtrace (like we do for MySQL errors) to the PHP error handler in misc.inc.  Also adding to watchdog
  when we get a warning or error from the handler.
  
  Changed the way cookies are unset on logout, to fix an issue where they were not being unset correctly, but also
  to handle possible array notation in the cookie names.  See system.module
  
  Made changes to watchdog severity level for certain types of data, in anticipation of a module which would delete, for example,
  "WATCHDOG_DEBUG" entries after X amount of time, since they are the least important.  Also made changes to the PHP error handler
  so it correctly identifies in the watchdog whether it was a PHP error or warning, and adjusts the severity constant accordingly.
  
  Fixed typo in user settings pulldown menu.
  
  Made it so if you are not logged in, the left sidebar menu shows a link to the login page.
  

2021-06-17
  Fixed small typo in form_error() message when rejecting a saved degree.
  
  In student_search module, got rid of the "majors"-related permissions.  Also cleaned up code which had been commented out.
  

2021-06-16
  Adding in new setting to disable all student logins (unless whitelisted).  It's in the System Settings form.

  Added is_disabled and last_login to fields in the user object.

  Added new hook to allow easy manipulation of student profile items in the "currently advising" box at top of screen.

  Changing user_settings to be a key/value pair type table, making it easy to add new settings in the future.

  Created new table called "user_attributes", and it's used the same as user_settings.  This lets us store details about
  a student, for example, if they are an athlete or student worker, etc, w/o having to hard-code any values.  We are removing the
  student_attributes and faculty_attributes tables at the same time; user_attributes will replace both tables.
  
  

2021-06-15
  Added more literal strings to t() function so they can be translated.
  

2021-06-13
  Changed system.install so that institution_id is a 100 varchar in the database, instead of 10.  Also made `name` an index for transfer_institutions table.
  
  Removed some default character set and collation vals from .install scripts, as this can cause a problem in MySQL 8+.
  
  Removed apply_draft_changes logic from schools module, since no longer needed and causing error.  Cleaned up old code.  Made sure
  What If mode only showed correct degrees based on the students' school.
  
  Added logic in schools and admin.degrees.inc when copying a degree, make sure to keep up with school id.
  
  Fixed Duplicate entire catalog year function to also respect school_id.
  

2021-06-12
  Working on schools functionlity for groups & definitions.
  
  Fixed a bug where icon filename field was no longer visible when editing degrees.
  
  Tweaks to popup which displays the degrees using group.
  
  Added a confirm dialog when changing schools, since it could cause all sorts of problems.
  
  Watchdog insert was failing because anon user school_id was null; wasn't being intval'd.

  Fixing PHP warning in system_init().

2021-06-11
  Added _validate function when editing a degree, so we can test for school mis-match.  Also fixed a bug where if there was more than one
  form_error() for the same element, it wouldn't display the red border around that element.  Also made it so that markup fields
  can also have form_error called on them.


2021-06-10
  Added ability to have group requirements (in degrees) with fractional hours.  Ex: 0.5 hours or 1.2 hours, etc.  Previously,
  when a group was loaded, the hours_required field was being intval()'d.  Changed to floatval().
  
  Fixed bug where course descriptions were not being cached correctly due to a typo.
  
  Wrapped "hours" and "hrs" with t() function so those words can be translated to "credits" if need be in a hook_translate function.

  Fixed bug where group couldn't be deleted from degree plan due to school_id being set.
  
  Worked on courses issues with schools.
  

2021-06-07
  Added schools select list option for user forms, made other cosmetic changes.
  
  Changed users module so that you can enter DEPT_CODE along with department.  Change table schema so that
  college, dept_code, and deparment are varchar 255.  Will use a machine name version of department if no DEPT_CODE
  is entered.
  
  Found a bug on the dashboard (system.module), where it states what day it is.  I was using strtotime("today"), which apparently
  was causing issues due to timezone conversions.  Switched it to time() and that fixed the issue.
  

2021-06-06
  Finishing up users screen for school id, both faculty and students.  Also added filter options to make it look
  more consistent.  Added pager to student users screen, since we might theoretically load the entire student
  list, both past and present.  It shows 30 at a time now.
  

2021-06-04
  Working on courses with new school_id.  Changed appearance of courses screen to look more like the other degree
  edit pages.  Made better use of tables and highlighting when you mouse over a row.  Added a filter form like others
  as well.
  

2021-06-03
  Added new schools filter option to degrees, and working on groups.  Filters on degrees list now actually
  a form (and added new form to groups) so other modules can modify with hook_form_alter if desired.  Right now,
  it's only really for the schools module.
  

2021-06-01
  Fixed bug in pager_query which was sometimes throwing numbers off.  Expanded functionality of the paget_query function.
  
  More work on school_id system, amending the need in some tables.  Decided to declare that CWIDs *must be unique* in FlightPath.
  Therefore, the users table will be the only place that a user's school_id is stored.
  
  Changed wording on user module, which stated CWID had to be numeric.  It does not.


2021-05-31
  Adding school_id to api and queries throughout FlightPath.
  

2021-05-27
  Changing some style issues when listing multiple degrees for a student.
  
  Change wording for select of tracks if you are required to select a certain number of tracks for a degree.
  
  Fixed bug where you couldn't override a semester block title unless you also had a course.
  

2021-05-25
  Added schools module to core, and made changes to system.install as well as other .install files, so that tables
  now have a school_id field and needed keys.
  

2021-05-16
  Added lots of changes to student search. We now can see Academic Priority.  Uses pager query and table sort as well.  No
  more limit on 300 students, since we can do pager.  Made table headers responsive, as well as priority vals.


2021-05-11
  Added ability to have custom logout messages.
  

2021-05-09
  Added "last_login" column to users table, and to users screen in admin console.  Also make it so the "contact FlightPath production team" link
  does not appear if no email address is entered.
  

2021-05-05
  In the school settings form, you may now choose to sort courses in degrees and groups not by alphabetical, but by the order
  in which they were entered.


2021-05-04
  Added fields to groups and group_requirements tables (incl. draft_) to facilitate public notes in groups,
  as well as "attributes" on a per-requirement level.
  
  Changed popup description to use fp_alert() function, with base64 encoding so we don't have to worry
  about trouble characters, and can enter HTML as well.
  

2021-04-21
  Made it simpler to define "unavailable days" for scheduling appointments.
  
  Fixed unavailable times table to look cleaner and easier to understand.

2021-02-20
  Added the base_url to the server name when sending mysql errors via email.

2020-10-07
	Initial commit of 6.x branch.  There are about to be various changes to FlightPath, which warrants 
	a new major version.
