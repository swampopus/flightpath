FlightPath 5.x Changelog
========================

2016-02-18
  Fixed stray mysql_insert_id() command in _FlightPath.php.  Changed to db_insert_id().
  
  Made it to where if you skipped semesters on the degrees page, it will still show the blank
  boxes, at least before where you skipped.
  
  Fixed issue so that public notes (on degrees) show up correctly, no matter how many degrees
  are being combined.  


2016-02-17
  Fixed bug where group id was not being maintained for certain groups in popup window.
  
  Made various changes in an attempt to help speed up page loads.


2016-02-15
  Fixed bug in misc.inc which was causing a new database connection *every time* a connection was requested (instead of re-using the
  global one).
  

2016-02-13
  Fixed bug in install script so that track major codes can have up to 20 characters.
  
  Modified the add degree form, to check to make sure tracks and major codes don't contain spaces,
  as well as fall below the 20 character limit.
  
  Fixed but which was intruduced by removing submissions form sessions.  As a result, forms which didn't
  validate didn't retain values.  Instead made it so only password fields were hidden from the session.
  
  Added concept of an "advising weight" to degrees, and on the degree edit form.  This lets the admin set
  the order in which degrees are presented to a student.  Lower weights appear first.  Added new popup help
  topics to the degree edit page to help explain.
    

2016-02-11
  Made it to where combined degrees will overwrite semester block titles if they are set to.
  

2016-02-09
  Fixed MySQL bug when editing groups.  Fixed bug where group_min_hours_required should be group_min_hours_allowed in the database.
  Fixed bug in degree list filter when not using clean URLs.
  Fixed missing argument bug in db.inc for db_affected_rows().
  

2016-02-01
  Removed section from system.module where submissions were being temporarily stored in the session.  It wasn't being used anyway,
  and it presented a possible security issue on improperly secured servers.
  

2016-01-19
  Changed default password scheme to use new D7 inspired PHPass technique, instead of basic md5's.  Added new password.inc file, virtually identical to the
  one which ships with D7.
  

2016-01-14
  Converted the advising history tab to use the content render api, so other modules can add content to that page.
  Also made it so that past advising histories appear in a collapsible fieldset, to save space.
  

2016-01-11
  Changed course popup description to use new content render API system.
  
  Added "override_degree_hours" field to degrees and draft_degrees tables, and db_override_degree_hours in the _DegreeClass object,
  for future use.
  
  Made small tweaks to fix bugs so installation works correctly.
  

2016-01-07
  Workng on var hour groups, ie, "min_hours_allowed".  Also, added in mechanism for changing the name of FlightPath to something else, if desired.
  

2016-01-05
  Beginning work on optional min hours for groups.
  

2016-01-04
  Creating new render api system, for rendering arrays similar to form arrays.  This lets other modules hook in to make changes.
  
  Changed forms.inc to render.inc
