  Fixed PHP 8 warnings.
  
  Added watchdog entry if our custom error handler is unable to write to the errors file (that gets emailed out).

2024-06-21
  Worked on Mailgun webhook integration.  Made it so that all email attachments are encrypted.
  
  Renamed content.module's constant CONTENT_PRIVATE_FILE to CONTENT_ENCRYPTED_FILE to better describe what it is.
  Also changed some of the code in content.module's content_add_new_uploaded_file() function to better handle from emails.

  Show message on new Email form when the student has no email address available.

  or was generated by the system. Warning appeared when trying to find the author's CWID.
  

2024-06-16
  Added a robots.txt file to the project directory.
  
  Updated the README.txt file.
  
  Added .htaccess file to files directory
  
  Created ability for FlightPath to manage a "private" files directory within custom/files, which

  the error handling functionality (which emails on php errors) to use this new private dir.

2024-06-15
  Various changes to suppress warnings and deprecated notices in PHP 8.x
  
  Added spot to enter a temporary directory.
  
  Added code so that PHP errors collect in a temporary file, then get emailed as a digest once per cron run.
  
  When executing PHP code from the Admin Console, warnings are not suppressed with @.  This allows for testing
  error handling.
  

2024-06-04
  Added new system setting, allowing the trimming of ERROR messages from the watchdog table based on age.
  
  Made changes to other files for warnings generated by PHP 8.2.

  the "report contact" form.

  either of those files/locations later on, without disrupting custom scripts.

2024-03-20
  To fix XSS vulnerability, modified Content module to disallow dangerous HTML (like script tags)
  in titles.


2024-03-15
  Fixed various deprecated warnings for PHP 8.2.
  
  Fixed issue where substitutions were no longer working, due to changes in how PHP 8.2
  compares numbers and strings.
  
  Added new function fp_trim(), which is meant to act as a drop-in replacement for trim(),
  except that it can accept NULL or FALSE and return ''.  Regular trim() cannot do this
  without triggering a deprecated warning.

  being handled in the Content module.

  Cleaning code of deprecated & warning messages.
