 * Otherwise, FlightPath will not be aware of your changes.  This can be done on the /admin-tools/admin page.
 * 
 * This function should return an array containing everything FP needs to correctly set up
 * the menu item.
 *  
 * First, the index of the array should be the URL itself.
 * Ex: $items["my/url"] = array(
 *   ...
 * );
 * 
 * The URL is allowed to contain wildcards (%).
 * Ex:
 * $items["content/%/edit"] = array(...);
 * 
 * The wildcard is in position "1", since the URL pieces begin with zero ("0").
 * 
 * Here are what the inner parts of the array mean:
 *  - title : The title of the page or menu item.  Should not be wrapped in t() function.
 *  - page_callback: A string which defines the function to call when this URL is accessed.
 *  - page_arguments: An optional array of arguments to pass to the callback function.  May contain numerican references to wildcards in the URL.
 *  - access_callback: A string which defines a function to call to determine if the user may access this URL.  
 *    Can be set to TRUE if this URL is open to anyone.  May be omitted if you simply want to test if the user has a particular
 *    permission, by only setting access_arguments.
 *  - access_arguments: An array containing the arguments to pass to the access_callback function.  If the access_callback
 *    function is omitted, it is assumed to be "user_has_permission", in which case you may simply specify
 *    an array of permissions here. May contain numerican references to wildcards in the URL.
 *  - type: A constant value describing the type of menu item it is.  Examples are: 
 *    - MENU_TYPE_NORMAL_ITEM - A standard menu item.  Will output as a link if the URL conforms to certain requirements.
 *    - MENU_TYPE_CALLBACK - A menu item which will not display itself on any blocks.
 *    - MENU_TYPE_TAB - A menu item which will output the page it draws with a tab at the top, or part of a tab family.
 *    - MENU_TYPE_SUB_TAB - This will output the page as a "sub tab" under the main tab.  Ex: the student search tab's subtabs, or
 *      the View tab's Display by Year and Display By Type sub tabs.
 *  - tab_family: If this menu item is a tab, specifying a machine name for the tab family will group all other tabs
 *    in that family together, and draw the other tabs in that family at the top of the screen.
 *  - tab_parent: The *path* of the parent tab for this menu item.  Will cause the parent tab's name to be displayed
 *    as a tab at the top of the page.  Ex: "admin-tools/admin"
 *  - weight: Optional number, for when menu items are being displayed in a block.  Smaller weights appear first.
 *  - file: Path to a file that this menu item's callback is located in.
 *  - page_settings: This is an optional array which allows for more detailed control over how the menu item and the page
 *    it draws will look.  Ex:  "page_settings" => array( //....//);  See below:
 *    - page_has_search: TRUE or FALSE, whether or not the search box will be drawn at the top of the screen.  This is the
 *      search box which searches for students.
 *    - page_show_title: TRUE if the page should display the title at the top of the content region.
 *    - page_banner_is_link: TRUE or FALSE.  Does the banner at the top of the screen link back to the Main tab.  Not implemented right now.
 *    - page_hide_report_error: TRUE or FALSE.  Should the "Contact the FlightPath Production Team" link be shown at the bottom of the screen.
 *    - page_is_popup: TRUE or FALSE.  Whether or not the page is going to be displayed in a popup.  Will remove the banner and other
 *      elements which might not look good in a popup window.
 *    - display_greeting: TRUE or FALSE. Should the page have the greeting text at the top? Ex: see the Main tab.
 *    - display_currently_advising: TRUE or FALSE. Should the page display the "Currently Advising" box at the top of the page?
 *    - screen_mode: If set to "not_advising" while display_currently_advising is set to TRUE, it will not display the options
 *      to change degree options or advising terms.
 *    - bool_print: Set to TRUE if this page is meant to be printable (it is formatted to print easily).
 *    - target: The anchor target of this menu item (if it is drawn in a block). Ex: "_blank"
 *    - menu_icon: A string which points to an icon to display with this link, if it is being displayed in a block.
 *    - menu_links: An array of links.  This is an array of parameters which would fit very will into the l() function.
 *      The links will appear as simple links at the top of the page.  Will be filtered through hook_menu_handle_replacement_pattern().
 *      Ex:  "menu_links" => array(0 => array("text"=>"link", "path"=>"admin/tools", "query"=>"name=bob"))
 *      - 0..n
 *        - text: The text of the link
 *        - path: The internal path of the link. Ex: "admin-tools/admin"
