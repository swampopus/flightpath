A brief history...
----------------------

FlightPath was created by the University of Louisiana at Monroe
(http://www.ulm.edu) in 2006, and has been in continuous use
ever since.

The decision to release the code as open source (GNU GPLv3) occured in 2011.

While the project is now contributed to by a community of developers,
the original ULM development team from 2006 were as follows:

Richard Peacock - Primary developer
Joe Mansour - Mainframe/Banner coordinator
Joann Perrer - Degree and course data coordinator

The "classic" theme, seen in FlightPath 1x - 4x, was created by 
Paul Gullette, with the original "feather" banner graphic designed 
by Rob Glaze.

Some icons used by FlightPath are part of the Silk icon set, created by Mark James, 
and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License.
