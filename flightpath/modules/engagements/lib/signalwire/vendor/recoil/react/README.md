Integrate [Recoil](https://github.com/recoilphp/recoil) with [ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp/reactphp).

    composer require recoil/react

This repository provides a Recoil kernel implemented on top of the ReactPHP
event loop, allowing cooperative execution of Recoil and ReactPHP applications.

ReactPHP promises can be yielded from a coroutine as though they were a native
Recoil coroutine.
